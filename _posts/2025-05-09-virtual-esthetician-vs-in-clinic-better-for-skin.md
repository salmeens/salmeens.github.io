Skincare isn’t one-size-fits-all—and neither is how you get help.

If you're debating between a **virtual skincare consultation** or an in-clinic facial, here’s what you need to know before booking either.

---

## When a Virtual Esthetician is Better:

- You need clarity, not just a facial
- You want a personalized skincare plan, not a product shelf pitch
- You live remotely or prefer privacy
- You’ve tried everything and nothing sticks

Virtual sessions focus on **education and strategy**—you get answers, not steam.

---

## When an In-Clinic Visit Makes Sense:

- You want hands-on treatments (facials, extractions, etc.)
- You’re prepping for a wedding or event and want the glow
- You love the spa experience

---

## What If You Could Combine Both?

Start virtually to build your skin foundation.  
Then use in-clinic treatments to enhance results.  
It’s not either-or—it’s strategy.
