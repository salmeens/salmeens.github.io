You’re doing the double cleanse. You bought the serum. You’re trying your best.  
But… your skin still feels off?

Chances are, one of these **common skincare mistakes** is to blame.

## 1. Over-exfoliating (yes, even “just once a week”)

You don’t need acids on rotation. If your skin’s sensitive, tight, or flaking, lay off the exfoliants and focus on repair.  
*Pro tip:* most people don’t need glycolic *and* retinol *and* salicylic. Pick one.

## 2. Layering too much, too fast

New moisturizer + serum + oil + mask in one night? Your skin isn’t a science experiment. Introduce new products slowly—one at a time, once every 3–5 days.

## 3. Ignoring your skin type

Your bestie’s routine might break your skin. What works for oily, acne-prone skin won’t work for barrier-compromised, dry skin. That’s why understanding your skin type matters.
