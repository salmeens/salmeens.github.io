So you’re ready to get serious about your skin. But now you're stuck in the classic skincare question:

**Dermatologist or esthetician—who do you actually need?**

Let’s break it down without ego, fluff, or gatekeeping.

---

## What’s the Difference?

### **Dermatologist**
A medical doctor who diagnoses and treats skin diseases.  
Think: eczema, psoriasis, severe acne, skin cancer, rosacea, fungal infections, etc.

They can:
- Prescribe medication
- Do biopsies
- Offer lasers, injectables, peels
- Diagnose underlying health issues

They’re skin doctors. But here’s the thing—they’re not always routine-focused or product-savvy. Many will tell you to use CeraVe and call it a day.

### **Esthetician**
A licensed skin specialist trained in:
- Skin analysis
- Routine building
- Ingredient education
- Barrier repair
- Professional facials, extractions, peels

We don’t treat disease—we guide, support, and help you build habits and routines that prevent problems and support long-term skin health.

## So Who Should You See?

### Book a Dermatologist If:
- You have a *medical* issue: cystic acne, severe rashes, suspicious moles
- You need prescriptions like tretinoin or antibiotics
- You’re experiencing pain, swelling, or skin conditions that aren’t improving

### Book an Esthetician If:
- Your skin feels “off” but not medical-level urgent
- You’ve tried multiple products and nothing is working
- You don’t know your skin type or what your routine should look like
- You need help healing your barrier, managing sensitivity, or simplifying

**TL;DR: Dermatologists diagnose. Estheticians guide.**  
One isn’t better than the other—we just have different lanes.

## What Makes My Approach Different

As an esthetician with a science background, I go beyond trendy routines and teach you:
- How your skin actually works
- How to avoid barrier damage
- Which products serve your skin (and which just waste your money)

My **virtual consultations** are about building a routine that fits *your skin, your life, and your budget.*

Because 90% of the time, skincare issues start with treating the wrong skin type.

## Final Word

You don’t need a 12-step routine.  
You need clarity.

Sometimes that comes from a derm.  
Sometimes from an esthetician.  
And sometimes—from someone who knows when to refer you to both.

Let’s figure it out together.
