If you’re using products designed for oily skin but your face still feels tight—there’s a good chance you’ve misdiagnosed your skin type. You’re not alone. Most people guess. And most people get it wrong.

Here’s how to actually figure out your **real skin type**—without relying on trendy quizzes or TikTok tips.

## Why Knowing Your Skin Type Matters

Your skin type is the foundation of every skincare decision:
- What cleanser you should use
- Whether you need exfoliation or hydration
- How many steps your routine really needs

If you get this wrong? Everything else falls apart. Products backfire, your barrier gets wrecked, and you’re stuck chasing “fixes” that make things worse.

## The Most Common Mistake: Confusing Skin Condition With Skin Type

Dry skin and dehydrated skin are not the same.  
Neither are oily and acne-prone.

Your **skin type** is mostly genetic and long-term (like dry, oily, combo).  
Your **skin condition** is short-term and influenced by lifestyle (like sensitivity, dehydration, breakouts, barrier damage).

## How to Identify Your Skin Type (At Home)

### 1. Cleanse + Wait

- Wash your face with a gentle cleanser.
- Don’t apply anything afterward.
- Wait 60 minutes.

Then observe:

- **Tight + flaky:** likely dry
- **Shiny all over:** oily
- **Shiny T-zone, dry cheeks:** combination
- **Fine, soft texture but tight later in the day:** could be dehydrated

### 2. Check How Your Skin Reacts to Products

- Does everything sting or break you out?
- Do you need to reapply moisturizer often?
- Does makeup slide off quickly?

Your reactions are just as important as your appearance.

That’s where a professional skin analysis comes in.

I offer **virtual skincare consultations** that break this down in one session, with a custom routine to match.
