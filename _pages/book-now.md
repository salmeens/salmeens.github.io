      <h2 class="brand-subheading">How It Works</h2>
      <p class="brand-text">You can book me for a paid virtual 1:1 consultation. Here's how it works:</p>
      <ol class="brand-list">
        <li>Fill out the quick inquiry form—tell me about your skin and your goals.</li>
        <li>I’ll review your answers and get in touch (email or text—your choice).</li>
        <li>If we’re a good fit, I’ll invite you to a free 10-minute discovery call.</li>
        <li>You’ll have 48 hours to confirm.</li>
        <li>After the call, if you’d like to move forward, you can book your full 40-minute consultation.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="brand-text">This process helps me make sure every session is intentional, focused, and personalized just for you.</p>
      
      <h3 class="brand-subheading">During the Consultation</h3>
      <ul class="brand-list">
        <li>I'll assess your skin and take note of your concerns, lifestyle habits, and current routine.</li>
        <li>I'll identify what's helping and what's holding you back in your current routine.</li>
        <li>Then I'll create a customized skincare plan that actually fits your goals — and your life.</li>
      </ul>
