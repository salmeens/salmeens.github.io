# About Me

I’m Salmeen, a licensed esthetician with a background in nanotechnology and over five years of experience consulting people on skincare—virtually, globally, and professionally.

What started as a fascination with how ingredients work on the skin turned into a full-time mission: making skincare simple, effective, and personal. My consultations are rooted in science, not hype—because your skin deserves real answers, not marketing fluff.

I’ve worked with people across different skin tones and concerns, helping them build routines they can actually stick to—routines that feel right, work with their lifestyle, and don’t break the bank.

If you’re tired of guessing and ready for expert support that feels like a smart friend who knows skin inside out—I’m here.

Let’s make skincare feel like self-respect, not a struggle.
